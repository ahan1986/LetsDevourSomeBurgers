# LetsDevourSomeBurgers

### Overview

This web application was created using MySQL, Node, Expressm Handlebars and a basic ORM.  The Node and MySQL was used to query and route the data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML page.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets the users input the names of a burger they would like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app's data will be stored in mySQL workbench.
